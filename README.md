# Claude on Slack

**🚧 DEVELOPMENT STATUS - ALPHA/BETA VERSION 🚧**

**⚠️ This project is currently in active development and not yet production-ready. Expect bugs, breaking changes, and incomplete features.**

**🤖 Your Personal AI Assistant - Jarvis in Chat Mode (In Development)**

**Code from anywhere - even your mobile phone!** Claude on Slack brings the power of programming to your fingertips through natural conversation with AI, accessible wherever you have Slack.

## 🏠 Vision: The Gateway to AI-Powered Home Automation

Imagine having **Jarvis, but in chat mode** - that's the dream I'm building toward! Right now, this project lets you:

### 📱 **Current Reality: Code Anywhere**
- **Mobile Development**: Write, debug, and deploy code from your phone through Slack chat
- **Natural Conversation**: No command syntax - just talk to the AI about what you want to build
- **Persistent Sessions**: Your coding conversations continue across devices and time
- **Image Analysis**: Upload screenshots of errors, diagrams, or hardware setups for instant feedback

### 🚀 **Future Vision: True Home Control** 
The real reason I built this is to eventually control **all my devices** by just chatting with the AI. The plan:

- **IoT Integration**: Connect smart lights, sensors, cameras, and home systems (coming soon!)
- **Remote Machine Control**: Manage home servers, deploy apps, monitor systems - all through chat
- **Automated Workflows**: Create intelligent scripts that respond to natural language commands
- **Device Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple systems and devices through conversational AI

### 🔧 **Current State: Active Development**
**Honest Reality**: This project is in active development with ongoing bugs and stability issues. It's not production-ready yet.

**Development Roadmap to Stability**: 

### 🎯 **Phase 1: Alpha Stabilization (Current)**
- **Current Focus**: Core feature implementation and critical bug fixes
- **Status**: Actively adding features while maintaining basic functionality
- **Risk**: Things can easily break as we prioritize rapid development over stability

### 🧪 **Phase 2: Test-Driven Development Migration (Next)**
- **Goal**: Transition from "move fast and break things" to "move fast and don't break things"
- **Approach**: 
  - **High Code Coverage**: Implement comprehensive tests aiming for 80%+ coverage
  - **Code Refactoring**: Restructure existing code into testable, mockable components
  - **Test-First Development**: All new features must be written with tests first
- **Key Principle**: **Tests should rarely change** - only when requirements are genuinely misunderstood
- **Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks of focused testing implementation

### 🏆 **Phase 3: Production Stability (Future)**
- **Milestone**: Project considered stable when TDD practices are fully integrated
- **Definition of Stable**:
  - Every new feature requires passing tests before merge
  - Existing functionality protected by comprehensive test suite
  - Breaking changes become extremely rare and intentional only
  - Confident deployments with automated testing pipeline

### 📋 **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic, session management, database operations
- **Integration Tests**: Slack API interactions, database connections, file operations  
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows from Slack message to Claude response
- **Mocking Strategy**: External dependencies (Slack API, Claude CLI, database) properly mocked
- **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass before deployment

**Timeline**: Currently in Phase 1, targeting Phase 2 completion by Q4 2025

**But here's the magic**: Even in development, being able to code through conversation is the **entry point** to controlling anything programmatically! Want to control your lights? Write a script. Need to monitor your servers? Code it up. Want to automate your morning routine? Program it through chat.

**Your imagination is your limit** - and now you have the tools to build anything you can dream up! 🎨

## 📸 **Preview: See It In Action**

- 💬 **Conversational**: Just upload and ask questions - no special commands needed
- 🔄 **Seamless Integration**: Combine image analysis with your ongoing coding and automation conversations

## ⚠️ **Current Limitations & Cost Considerations**

### 🔗 **Dependency: Claude Code CLI**
This project is **heavily integrated** with [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) - that's both its superpower and current limitation:

- **✅ Pros**: Extremely reliable, powerful AI capabilities, seamless integration
- **⚠️ Cons**: Requires Anthropic's Claude subscription, not fully self-hosted

### 💰 **Real Cost Reality**  
**In my home setup, I pay $100/month for Claude Max subscription.**

- **Expensive?** Yes, kinda pricey for a personal setup
- **Worth it?** For me, totally worth it - but I understand it's a barrier for many
- **Future Goal**: Make this setup cheaper with alternative LLM integrations

### 🔮 **Future Alternatives (Maybe)**
Looking toward more self-hosted friendly options:

- **[AIDE](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)**: Potential integration for local LLM support
- **Custom Agent Development**: May develop custom agents for other LLMs  
- **Cost Reduction**: Working toward cheaper, self-hosted alternatives
- **Current Reality**: Claude Code CLI remains the main core due to reliability

### 🌐 **Network Requirements: Exposing Your Home Setup**
**Reality Check**: Your home is behind NAT, so Slack can't reach your endpoints directly.

**Solution Options**:
1. **Static IP**: If you have a machine with public static IP (lucky you!)
2. **Bastion Server**: Buy a cheap VPS for SSH tunneling (**Recommended**)

**💰 Bastion Server Cost**: ~$5/month from:
- **Digital Ocean**: Basic droplet
- **Linode**: Nanode plan  
- **Contabo**: VPS S plan

**Setup**: Use SSH port forwarding to expose Slack endpoints from your home network through the bastion server.

### 🔒 **IMPORTANT: Create Your Own Private Slack Workspace**

**⚠️ Security & Privacy Warning:**
**Create your own private Slack workspace** - don't use your work or shared Slack!

**Why this matters:**
- **Slack is FREE** for personal use - take advantage of it! 
- **You'll be the only user** in your personal workspace
- **Privacy**: Your home automation commands stay private
- **Security**: You don't want coworkers accidentally turning off your lights! 💡
- **Control**: Full admin control over your personal AI assistant

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to slack.com and create a **new workspace** 
2. Make it **private** and **personal** to you
3. Install your Claude-on-Slack bot there
4. Enjoy complete control over your digital home

**Remember**: This is YOUR personal Jarvis - keep it personal! 🏠🔒

### 🎯 **Total Real Cost**
- **Claude Max**: $100/month
- **Bastion Server**: $5/month  
- **Private Slack Workspace**: **FREE** 🆓
- **Total**: ~$105/month for full "Jarvis" experience

Worth it? For me, absolutely. Your mileage may vary! 💸

## 🚀 Quick Start

**⚠️ DEVELOPMENT WARNING**: This setup is for **developers and early adopters** only. Expect to encounter bugs and may need to troubleshoot issues during setup and usage.

### 🤖 **Golden Rule: Let Claude Do The Heavy Lifting!**

**Most importantly, to save yourself from headache, just use Claude to help you set this up - like I do!**

**💡 Pro Tip**: I literally ask Claude to set everything up for me. It's the perfect self-referential loop:
- Use Claude to set up Claude-on-Slack 
- Claude knows its own integration better than anyone
- Avoid configuration nightmares and debugging sessions

**Simply open Claude Code CLI and ask:**
```
"Help me set up claude-on-slack from https://github.com/ghabxph/claude-on-slack. 
I need help with:
• Slack app creation and OAuth configuration
• Environment setup (.env file configuration)
• Database setup (PostgreSQL with Docker)
• SSH tunneling setup for bastion server
• Deployment and systemd service configuration"
```

**Claude will walk you through**:
- Slack workspace configuration
- Bastion server SSH tunneling setup  
- PostgreSQL database initialization
- Environment variables configuration
- Service deployment and monitoring

**Why this works so well**: Claude understands the entire stack, knows common pitfalls, and can troubleshoot issues in real-time. Don't suffer through manual configuration - let the AI do what it does best! 🚀

### Manual Installation

**⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION**: Manual installation is **not recommended** for production use. This is an active development project with frequent breaking changes and known bugs.
