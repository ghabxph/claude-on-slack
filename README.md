# Claude on Slack

A Slack bot that enables natural language interaction with Claude Code directly in Slack channels, providing seamless AI assistance for development teams.

## üéØ Overview

Claude on Slack bridges the gap between Slack conversations and Claude Code's powerful AI capabilities, allowing teams to:

- Have natural conversations with Claude without command parsing
- Maintain session context across multiple interactions  
- Collaborate on code analysis, debugging, and development tasks
- Access Claude's file operations, code generation, and analysis tools
- Control permissions and access levels through slash commands

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and configured
- Slack workspace with bot creation permissions
- Go 1.21+ for building the service

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/ghabxph/claude-on-slack.git
   cd claude-on-slack
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual tokens and working directory
   ```

3. **Install as systemd service (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install as current user (for security)
   sudo ./scripts/install.sh

   # Or specify a different user
   sudo CLAUDE_SERVICE_USER=youruser ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

4. **Manual build and run**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go build -o slack-claude-bot ./cmd/slack-claude-bot
   ./slack-claude-bot
   ```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required configuration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token

SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret

# Claude Code CLI configuration
CLAUDE_CODE_PATH=claude
ALLOWED_TOOLS=                    # Empty = all tools (full access)

# Access control
ALLOWED_USERS=user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com
ADMIN_USERS=admin@domain.com

# Auto-response channels (optional)
AUTO_RESPONSE_CHANNELS=C1234567890  # Channel ID where bot responds to ALL messages

# Deployment notification channels (optional)
DEPLOYMENT_NOTIFY_CHANNELS=C1234567890,C0987654321  # Comma-separated channel IDs for deployment notifications

# Server settings (for SSH tunnel setup)
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=8080

# Working directory (set to your home directory for full system access)
WORKING_DIRECTORY=/home/yourusername
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Interaction

Just talk naturally to Claude! No special commands or formatting needed:

```
@claude-bot Can you help me optimize this code?

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

@claude-bot Can you create a dockerfile for a python web app?
```

- Offers session selection when multiple sessions exist for the same path

### Multi-Session Support (Enhanced)
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Run multiple Claude conversations simultaneously
- **Per-Session Modes**: Each session maintains independent permission settings
- **Database Persistence**: Sessions persist across service restarts

### Image Support (Research)
‚Ä¢ Support for processing images uploaded to Slack channels (not yet implemented)
‚Ä¢ Research in progress for integrating Claude's image analysis capabilities
‚Ä¢ Will enable visual debugging, code review from screenshots, and more

### Code Edit Visualization
We're working on showing code changes directly in chat:
```diff
# Example future output:
File: src/utils.ts:45
- function getData(id: string): Promise<Data> {
+ async function getData(id: string): Promise<Data | null> {
    const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM data WHERE id = ?', [id]);
-   return result[0];
+   return result[0] || null;
  }
```

This will help you:
- See exactly what Claude changed
- Track file and line locations
- Understand the context of changes
- Review changes before accepting them
