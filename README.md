# Claude on Slack

**ü§ñ Your Personal AI Assistant - Jarvis in Chat Mode**

**Code from anywhere - even your mobile phone!** Claude on Slack brings the power of programming to your fingertips through natural conversation with AI, accessible wherever you have Slack.

## üè† Vision: The Gateway to AI-Powered Home Automation

Imagine having **Jarvis, but in chat mode** - that's the dream I'm building toward! Right now, this project lets you:

### üì± **Current Reality: Code Anywhere**
- **Mobile Development**: Write, debug, and deploy code from your phone through Slack chat
- **Natural Conversation**: No command syntax - just talk to the AI about what you want to build
- **Persistent Sessions**: Your coding conversations continue across devices and time
- **Image Analysis**: Upload screenshots of errors, diagrams, or hardware setups for instant feedback

### üöÄ **Future Vision: True Home Control** 
The real reason I built this is to eventually control **all my devices** by just chatting with the AI. The plan:

- **IoT Integration**: Connect smart lights, sensors, cameras, and home systems (coming soon!)
- **Remote Machine Control**: Manage home servers, deploy apps, monitor systems - all through chat
- **Automated Workflows**: Create intelligent scripts that respond to natural language commands
- **Device Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple systems and devices through conversational AI

### üîß **Current State: The Foundation**
**Honest Reality**: There are no explicit home automation libraries integrated yet - this is the foundation that makes it all possible.

**But here's the magic**: Being able to code through conversation is the **entry point** to controlling anything programmatically! Want to control your lights? Write a script. Need to monitor your servers? Code it up. Want to automate your morning routine? Program it through chat.

**Your imagination is your limit** - and now you have the tools to build anything you can dream up! üé®

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations & Cost Considerations**

### üîó **Dependency: Claude Code CLI**
This project is **heavily integrated** with [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) - that's both its superpower and current limitation:

- **‚úÖ Pros**: Extremely reliable, powerful AI capabilities, seamless integration
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Cons**: Requires Anthropic's Claude subscription, not fully self-hosted

### üí∞ **Real Cost Reality**  
**In my home setup, I pay $100/month for Claude Max subscription.**

- **Expensive?** Yes, kinda pricey for a personal setup
- **Worth it?** For me, totally worth it - but I understand it's a barrier for many
- **Future Goal**: Make this setup cheaper with alternative LLM integrations

### üîÆ **Future Alternatives (Maybe)**
Looking toward more self-hosted friendly options:

- **[AIDE](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)**: Potential integration for local LLM support
- **Custom Agent Development**: May develop custom agents for other LLMs  
- **Cost Reduction**: Working toward cheaper, self-hosted alternatives
- **Current Reality**: Claude Code CLI remains the main core due to reliability

### üåê **Network Requirements: Exposing Your Home Setup**
**Reality Check**: Your home is behind NAT, so Slack can't reach your endpoints directly.

**Solution Options**:
1. **Static IP**: If you have a machine with public static IP (lucky you!)
2. **Bastion Server**: Buy a cheap VPS for SSH tunneling (**Recommended**)

**üí∞ Bastion Server Cost**: ~$5/month from:
- **Digital Ocean**: Basic droplet
- **Linode**: Nanode plan  
- **Contabo**: VPS S plan

**Setup**: Use SSH port forwarding to expose Slack endpoints from your home network through the bastion server.

### üéØ **Total Real Cost**
- **Claude Max**: $100/month
- **Bastion Server**: $5/month  
- **Total**: ~$105/month for full "Jarvis" experience

Worth it? For me, absolutely. Your mileage may vary! üí∏

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ü§ñ **Golden Rule: Let Claude Do The Heavy Lifting!**

**Most importantly, to save yourself from headache, just use Claude to help you set this up - like I do!**

**üí° Pro Tip**: I literally ask Claude to set everything up for me. It's the perfect self-referential loop:
- Use Claude to set up Claude-on-Slack 
- Claude knows its own integration better than anyone
- Avoid configuration nightmares and debugging sessions

**Simply open Claude Code CLI and ask:**
```
"Help me set up claude-on-slack from https://github.com/ghabxph/claude-on-slack. 
I need help with:
‚Ä¢ Slack app creation and OAuth configuration
‚Ä¢ Environment setup (.env file configuration)
‚Ä¢ Database setup (PostgreSQL with Docker)
‚Ä¢ SSH tunneling setup for bastion server
‚Ä¢ Deployment and systemd service configuration"
```

**Claude will walk you through**:
- Slack workspace configuration
- Bastion server SSH tunneling setup  
- PostgreSQL database initialization
- Environment variables configuration
- Service deployment and monitoring

**Why this works so well**: Claude understands the entire stack, knows common pitfalls, and can troubleshoot issues in real-time. Don't suffer through manual configuration - let the AI do what it does best! üöÄ

### Manual Installation
